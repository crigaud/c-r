I lived three months in Japan in early 2013 for my work and I took advantage of my free time to explore the culture, customs and traditions.
During the week, I lived in Sakai, south from Osaka. Osaka is located in the southern half of the main island of Japan (Honshu). It is two times larger than Paris (Tokyo, the largest metropolis in the world, is ten times larger than Paris).
During the weekend, I visited nearby cities like Kyoto, Nara, Koya and one day in Tokyo and Nikko.

<h4>Travel </h4>
<p>
From Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, it takes twelve hours depending on the airline. Air France offers direct flights but I traveled with China Eastern for less than 700â‚¬ round trip. This company has the advantage of accepting two bags of 23kg in economy class, perfect for bringing a lot of souvenirs.

<h4>First steps </h4>
<p>
Just out of Kansai International Airport (KIX) we take public transport to get the city of Osaka since the airport was built in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

<h4>Transportation </h4>
<p>
Most people travel by train because the car is expensive in tax and parking. Japan railway is exemplary in terms of the process, they are clean, frequent, on time (7 sec delay in average over the year) and serve more or less stops according to the category of the train (local, semi-express, express , limited express, shinkansen). Some have reversible seats to always be in the moving direction, with smokers and nonsmokers cars. The ticket prices are similar to France and foreigners can buy a pass called "Japan Rail Pass" which gives access to the majority of trains (JR, Shinkansen) at unbeatable price for a period of seven, fourteen or twenty-one days.
Another difference is that the price depends on distance and not time. Furthermore it is accepted to pay the price difference when you exit if you miss the stop for example, whitout extra fees.
People queue allong the appropriate line drawn on the floor. When the train arrives, they wait for all passengers exit before entering peacefully. Inside the train, there are some reserved seats for priority people (disabled, pregnant women, etc.). However there is no slot for bicycles but sometimes special car for women only.

<h4>Language </h4>
<p>
The Japanese language does not use Latin letters as the French once but three syllabaries: Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji. It is recommanded to learn these tables of symbols before the stay (especially the two first ones) to be able to read few words out of transport networks that are transcribed into romaji (Latin letters). English is important to know even if the average level is, in my point of view, less than that the french one.
</p>
<h4>Behavior </h4>
<p>
Japanese are mostly clean, careful, respectful, punctual, disciplined and hardworker. There is very few contact between people, they salute each other to say hello and goodbye, and wear a mask that covers the mouth and nose (one in three) not to transmit or receive microbes and for air pollution.
They eat at regular times, the food is very varied, often with rice and tea, and lightly salted with chopsticks. Traditionally squatting around a low table. Their ways of eating food differs, for example, they eat noodles (Udon or Soba) in a broth and aspire strongly to make noise and show their happyness.
